# Errors

## Code 4xx

When Navitia is unable to give an answer, you'll receive a 4XX http code response. For 400 and 404 errors, an error object
containing a unique error id is given for better understanding.

```shell
#request
$ curl 'https://api.navitia.io/v1/coverage/sandbox/stop_areas/wrong-one' -H 'Authorization: 3b036afe-0110-4202-b9ed-99718476c2e0'

#response
HTTP/1.1 404 OK

{
    "error": {
        "id": "bad_filter",
        "message": "ptref : Filters: Unable to find object"
    }
}
```

There are six possible 4xx http codes.

### 400: bad request

| Error id          | Description                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| bad_filter        | When you use a custom filter                                |
| unable_to_parse   | When you use a mal-formed custom filter                     |
| unknown_api       | When you request an inexistant endpoint                     |
| bad_format        | When you provide ill-formated parameter (coord for example) |
| config_exception  | When you try to configure an external service (street network back-end or autocomplete) with wrong parameters |


### 401: unauthorized

When no token is provided/found in the request.

### 403: forbidden

When the token is not allowed to request the coverage.

### 404: unable to find an object

| Error id                    | Description                                                                	| Services                  |

| no_active_circulation_this_day | No more vehicles stop for today (for example, it's too late)             | /departures /arrivals /stop_schedules /terminus_schedules /route_schedules |
| terminus                    | There will never be departures, you're at the terminus of the line          | /departures /arrivals /stop_schedules /terminus_schedules /route_schedules |

### 413: request too large

When the response generated by the request exceeds 10 MB (few APIs are not yet concerned by this limitation but this may change in the future).

Tips to work around this error:

* [paginate](#paging)
* reduce the parameter `depth`
* on large `journeys`, reduce the time frames, durations, _etc_

### 429: too many requests

When you request too many times the API during one second according to your token.

Tips to work around this error:

* rerun your request after an exponential backoff
* give up your request
* contact us for a [quotation](https://navitia.io/demande-de-devis/)

## Code 200

Even if everything is correct (input parameters, internal processing)
Navitia can end up finding that the correct answer is empty.
